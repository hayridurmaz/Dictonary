# Dictonary
This is a Trie implementation which includes some different task files. Each task does different things:
- task1 : Simple trie execution
- task2 : sequentially read all the data and create dictonary
- task3 : Also sequental read but read multiple query at a time
- task4 : Threaded reading from files using one trie
- task5 : Threaded reading from files using multiple tries
- task6 : Reading files from disk and inserting queries to a very big array of chars, then creating dictonary.
## Compalation:
It is enough to execute make command in implementation folder.  

## Usage:
There are 6 executables in this project. You can execute either one by typing >**./taskTASKNUMBER** <br/> Example: >**./task5**
